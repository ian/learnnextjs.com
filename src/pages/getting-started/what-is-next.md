Next.js is an open-source React front-end framework that adds additional optimization capabilities like **server-side rendering** (SSR) and **static-site generation**

Next.js is a metaframework, built on top of React.js. For a great read on metaframeworks, see [the age of JavaScript frameworks](https://www.swyx.io/react-distros/#the-deployment-age-of-javascript-frameworks) by [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx).
